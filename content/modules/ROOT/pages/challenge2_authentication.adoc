== Challenge 2: Setup Authentication 

* **Hank Scorpio**: "Having this guest access does not work for me, I need you to set up proper authentication worthy of the **Globex Corp**!”

* **You**: "Not to worry. **The Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH)** relies on Authentication Providers to manage access. These providers help us retrieve identity and user details, enabling us to assign specific access rights across different services within **RHDH**. **RHDH** is compatible with several well-known authentication providers, including **GitHub**, **GitLab**, **Auth0**, **Okta** and more. 

* **You**: "**Homer**, let’s go ahead and set up authentication using **GitHub**. Configuring **GitHub** for **RHDH** authentication involves two steps:""

. Creating a new **GitHub App** for your **GitHub organization**.
. Configure **RHDH** to use the **GitHub App** for authentication.

---

=== Task 1: Create a GitHub Application

* **You**: "The first step is to create a new **GitHub Organization** and name it **<your_team_name>-org**. Then invite members of the PoC team to join **GitHub Organization**."

NOTE: Only one member of your team needs to create the GitHub Organization. The Organization Owner is responsible for creating the GitHub Application and inviting team members to the Organization. Team members have to accept the invitation from their respective Github accounts. There should be at least two members in the Organization.

* **You**: "Then, create a new **GitHub Application**, navigate to [GitHub App Settings]: https://github.com/organizations/<YOUR_ORGANIZATION>/settings/apps "

* **You**: “On the 'Register new GitHub App' page, fill out the following details:

** **GitHub App name**: `rhdh-app-<your_team_name>` 
** **Homepage URL**: `<Your RHDH Route URL>`
** **Callback URL**: `<Your RHDH Route URL>api/auth/github/handler/frame`
** **Webhook URL**: `<Your RHDH Route URL>`
** **Webhook secret**: `7opS3cr3tK3y` 

* **You**: “Expand Repository Permissions, and toggle **Read and Write** permissions for the following:

** Administration
** Commit statuses
** Contents
** Dependabot alerts
** Deployments
** Pull Requests
** Webhooks

* "Under Organization permissions, ensure that you toggle Read-only permissions for Members so that RHDH can import team and user information from GitHub.”

* “Click **Create GitHub App**. You will be shown your App ID and a client ID. Make note of these values for the next step.”

* “Click **Generate a new client secret**. Copy the generated secret for the next steps.”

* “Scroll down to the Private Keys section and click **Generate a private key**. The private key will be downloaded. Copy the generated private key certificate (it is in PEM format) to a safe location.”

* “In the left sidebar menu of the generated app, select **Install App**, and then click **Install**. Click **Install** on the next screen as well.”

=== Task 2: Configure RHDH to Use the GitHub App for Authentication

**You**: "Excellent with the **GitHub Application** ready, It's time to configure **Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH)**. **RHDH** configuration exists as **YAML** files, which are saved within **ConfigMaps** in **OpenShift**."

**Homer**: "D'oh! We have to follow a map!"

image::homer_doh.png[]

**You**: "Good one, **Homer**! But not exactly, **ConfigMaps** in **OpenShift** are used to store configuration data in key-value pairs. This data can be consumed by pods within the cluster. They are particularly useful for separating configuration from the application code, which makes managing and updating configurations much simpler and more efficient."

==== Step 1: Create a Custom Configuration File for RHDH

"The `default.app-config.yaml` is used to configure the overall configuration of **RHDH**. The `default.app-config.yaml` configuration is stored in the `backstage-appconfig-rhdh` ConfigMap is as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
data:
  default.app-config.yaml: |
    backend:
      auth:
        keys:
          # This is a default value, which you should change by providing your own app-config
          - secret: "pl4s3Ch4ng3M3"
----

* **You**: "The `default.app-config.yaml` file should not be edited directly to avoid problems during operator upgrades. Instead, you must define your own custom `app-config-rhdh.yaml` configuration file as a separate ConfigMap resource, and override the default configuration values."

* **You**: "Create a new ConfigMap named `app-config-rhdh` in the project `rhdh` using the following YAML snippet":

[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
 name: app-config-rhdh
data:
 "app-config-rhdh.yaml": |
   app:
     title: Red Hat Developer Hub
     baseUrl: <your rhdh route>
   backend:
     auth:
       keys:
         - secret: "${BACKEND_SECRET}"
     baseUrl: <your rhdh route>
     cors:
       origin: <your rhdh route>
   auth:
     environment: production
     providers:
       github:
         production:
           clientId: "${GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID}"
           clientSecret: "${GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET}"
   signInPage: github
----

* **You**: "Where it says `<your RHDH route>`, replace it with your **Red Hat Developer Hub** route. You will need to make this replacement in three places. After making these changes, click the **Create** button."

NOTE: The format of the route should be similar to this example `https://backstage-rhdh-rhdh.apps.cluster-64w6b.64w6b.sandbox1459.opentlc.com/` including the trailing slash (/) at the end.

==== Step 2: Create the Backend Secret

**Homer**: "What's this `${BACKEND_SECRET}`? Is it a secret agent code?"

* **You**: "Good catch, **Homer**. **Secrets** are used instead of plain text in **ConfigMaps** to enhance security. This is where we will store our Backend secret and **GitHub** credentials. Create a key/value secret named `rhdh-secrets`."

* **You**: "Enter `BACKEND_SECRET` in the Key field and `PwOD9zUumzQzLESkwWmYpLlQo1+H/qaQ` for the Value field.

NOTE: You can generate your backend secret using the following command `node -p 'require("crypto").randomBytes(24).toString("base64")'`. However, you will need to have Node installed on your local laptop to execute this.

* **You**: "Click **Add Key/Value** to add two more Key/Value pairs as follows:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|**Key**
|**Value**

|GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID
|<The GitHub APP Client ID you copied earlier>

|GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET
|<The GitHub APP Client Secret you copied earlier>
|===

* **You**: "Click the **Create** button.""

=== Step 3: Reference the Custom Configuration File in RHDH

* **Homer**: "All this just to log in? Can't we just knock on the door and ask nicely?"

* **You**: "I wish it were that simple, **Homer**. Now that you have created your own custom configuration files, you need to reference it in the **Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH)** custom resource (CR). If you’re not already in the **Developer** perspective, switch to it.  Click on **Topology** in the left sidebar, and then expand the hamburger menu (three vertical dots) next to the `rhdh` instance to select the 'Edit Backstage' option."

* **You**: "Add a reference to the `app-config-rhdh` ConfigMap and the `rhdh-secrets` secret in the **spec** section:"
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rhdh.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: Backstage
metadata:
...
spec:
  application:
    appConfig:
      mountPath: /opt/app-root/src
      configMaps:
         - name: app-config-rhdh
    extraEnvs:
      secrets:
         - name: rhdh-secrets
    extraFiles:
      mountPath: /opt/app-root/src
    replicas: 1
    route:
      enabled: true
  database:
    enableLocalDb: true
----

* **You**: "Click **Save** to save your changes. Now, you need to restart the **RHDH** pod for the changes to take effect. In the **Topology** view, expand the menu next to the `backstage-rhdh` pod and click **Restart rollout** to restart the **RHDH** pod."

* **You**: "Restarting the **backstage-rhdh** pod takes a few minutes. It first reloads the list of **dynamic plugins** before the actual **RHDH** instance starts. You can track this activity by clicking on the **backstage-rhdh** pod and then selecting **View logs** from the right pane."

image::rhdh_rollout_view_logs.png[]

** *You**: "Then in the **Logs** view, select the **install-dynamic-plugins** init container  first to view the plugins being installed. Once this is complete, you can switch to the **backstage-backend** container to monitor it as it starts up."

image::monitor_rhdh_startup.png[]

* **You**: "After the pod restarts, navigate to the **RHDH** URL. This time, the **Authentication** page will only display **GitHub** as an option for authentication." 

image::rhdh_github_authentication.png[]

* **You**: "Go ahead and click **Sign in**. You will be asked to authorize your new application to access your **Github** details. Once you do so, you should now see the **Homepage** for the **Red Hat Developer Hub**. "

image::rhdh_homepage.png[]

* **You**: "Now, click on ‘Settings’ in the bottom of the right menu and then click on the ‘Authentication Providers’ tab. Grab a screenshot of this page."
