== Challenge 1: Deploy Red Hat Developer Hub

* **Hank Scorpio**: “Alright team, listen up! We’re about to embark on an exciting journey to transform our development operations with the **Red Hat Developer Hub**. Homer, I need you to focus and follow our Red Hat expert’s guidance. Let’s get this project rolling!”

* **Homer**: “Mmm… Developer Hub… Wait, what’s a Developer Hub again? Oh well, as long as there’s doughnuts involved, I’m in!”

* **You**: “Great enthusiasm, Homer! Let’s dive into our first challenge. We need to create an OpenShift project called **rhdh** and install the RHDH operator.”

=== Task 1: Creating an OpenShift Project

**Globex Corp** needs a dedicated space within their **OpenShift** cluster to house the **Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH)** and its components. 

* **Homer**: “Uh, okay. So I need to create a new project? I can do that. Wait, can I name it doughnuts?”

* **You**: “Focus, Homer. We’ll stick with the name **rhdh**. Navigate to the OpenShift Console by right-clicking the following URL and selecting `Open Link in New Tab`.”

** *OpenShift Console URL:* {openshift_console_url}

* **You**: “You will be asked to choose between **kube:admin** or **rhsso**, choose *rhsso**.Here are the login details you’ll need:”

** *OpenShift Admin User* {openshift_admin_user}
** *OpenShift Admin Password* {openshift_admin_password}

* **You**: "After you log-in, create an **OpenShift** project called `rhdh`."

TIP: In case you are lost, check the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.15/html/building_applications/projects#working-with-projects[OpenShift documentation,window=_blank] on how to create a new project. You can refer to section 2.1.1.1, “Creating a project by using the web console”.

=== Task 2: Deploying the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator

* **You**: "Now that you have the project in place, it's time to deploy the **Red Hat Developer Hub Operator**."
* **Homer**: “Operator? Like someone who answers phones? I can do that! Wait, no, I can’t. What does this operator do again?”
* **You**: “The **Red Hat Developer Hub Operator** manages the lifecycle of our **RHDH** components. You’ll need to navigate to the **OperatorHub** in the **OpenShift** web console, and install **Red Hat Developer Hub Operator**.”

TIP: If you get stuck, Refer to the documentation, link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.2/html-single/installing_red_hat_developer_hub_on_openshift_container_platform/index#proc-install-operator_assembly-install-rhdh-ocp-operator[“1.1.1. Installing the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator”,window=_blank].

=== Task 3: Deploy Red Hat Developer Hub using the Operator

* **Hank Scorpio**: “Now that the groundwork is laid, it’s time to bring the whole system online. Let's deploy the Hub!"
* **Homer**: “Deploying, huh? That sounds serious. Do I need to push a big red button or something?”
* **You**: “Not quite, Homer. You’ll need to create an instance of **Red Hat Developer Hub** using the **Red Hat Developer Hub Operator** you just installed. Name your instance `rhdh` and make sure it is deployed to the correct namespace name, `rhdh`.”

TIP: Switch to `YAML view` to gain more control on how your RHDH instance will be deployed. If you need additional guidance, refer to the documentation section link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.1/html/administration_guide_for_red_hat_developer_hub/assembly-install-rhdh-ocp#proc-install-rhdh-ocp-operator_admin-rhdh[2.2. Deploying Red Hat Developer Hub on OpenShift Container Platform using the Operator,window=_blank].

**You**: "Switch to the topology view of the `rhdh` project. If all goes well, after a few minutes, you'll see both the pods, **backstage-rhdh** and **backstage-psql-rhdh** running."

* **You**: "Find the route for your **RHDH** instance and keep it handy as we will use it in the coming steps to configure **RHDH**. Now click on the route to navigate to the **RHDH Authentication Page**."

* **You**: "You'll see two options on the authentication page: one is to use **GitHub** and the other is to use a **Guest** account."
* **You**: "The Guest account is is highly not desired by **Globex Corp** as they want only authorized users to access the **Red Hat Developer Hub**. In the next challenge, we will remove the **Guest** account option and configure authentication and integration with **Github**."

* You are done with Challenge 1. Let let the moderators know by sharing this message on the slack channel: "<Your Team Name> completed challenge 1, please review."
